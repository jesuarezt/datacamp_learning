#Fitting multi-class logistic regression#

#In this exercise, you'll fit the two types of multi-class logistic regression, one-vs-rest and softmax/multinomial, on the handwritten digits data set and compare the results. The handwritten digits dataset is already loaded and split into X_train, y_train, X_test, and y_test.

# Fit one-vs-rest logistic regression classifier
lr_ovr = LogisticRegression()
lr_ovr.fit(X_train, y_train)

print("OVR training accuracy:", lr_ovr.score(X_train, y_train))
print("OVR test accuracy    :", lr_ovr.score(X_test, y_test))

# Fit softmax classifier
lr_mn = LogisticRegression(multi_class="multinomial", solver="lbfgs")
lr_mn.fit(X_train, y_train)

print("Softmax training accuracy:", lr_mn.score(X_train, y_train))
print("Softmax test accuracy    :", lr_mn.score(X_test, y_test))

#As motivation for the next and final chapter on support vector machines, we'll repeat the previous exercise with a non-linear SVM. Once again, the data is loaded into X_train, y_train, X_test, and y_test .#

#Instead of using LinearSVC, we'll now use scikit-learn's SVC object, which is a non-linear "kernel" SVM (much more on what this means in Chapter 4!). Again, your task is to create a plot of the binary classifier for class 1 vs. rest.

# We'll use SVC instead of LinearSVC from now on
from sklearn.svm import SVC

# Create/plot the binary classifier (class 1 vs. rest)
svm_class_1 = SVC()
svm_class_1.fit(X_train, y_train==1)
plot_classifier(X_train, y_train==1,clf = svm_class_1)
