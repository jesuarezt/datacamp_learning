#Using regularization in XGBoost
#
#Having seen an example of l1 regularization in the video, you'll now vary the l2 regularization penalty - also known as "lambda" - and see its effect on overall model performance on the Ames housing dataset.

# Create the DMatrix: housing_dmatrix
housing_dmatrix = xgb.DMatrix(data=X, label=y)

reg_params = [1, 10, 100]

# Create the initial parameter dictionary for varying l2 strength: params
params = {"objective":"reg:linear","max_depth":3}

# Create an empty list for storing rmses as a function of l2 complexity
rmses_l2 = []

# Iterate over reg_params
for reg in reg_params:

    # Update l2 strength
    params["lambda"] = reg
    
    # Pass this updated param dictionary into cv
    cv_results_rmse = xgb.cv(dtrain=housing_dmatrix, params=params, nfold=2, num_boost_round=5, metrics="rmse", as_pandas=True, seed=123)
    
    # Append best rmse (final round) to rmses_l2
    rmses_l2.append(cv_results_rmse["test-rmse-mean"].tail(1).values[0])

# Look at best rmse per l2 param
print("Best rmse as a function of l2:")
print(pd.DataFrame(list(zip(reg_params, rmses_l2)), columns=["l2", "rmse"]))




#Visualizing individual XGBoost trees
#
#Now that you've used XGBoost to both build and evaluate regression as well as classification models, you should get a handle on how to visually explore your models. Here, you will visualize individual trees from the fully boosted model that XGBoost creates using the entire housing dataset.
#
#XGBoost has a plot_tree() function that makes this type of visualization easy. Once you train a model using the XGBoost learning API, you can pass it to the plot_tree() function along with the number of trees you want to plot using the num_trees argument.

# Create the DMatrix: housing_dmatrix
housing_dmatrix = xgb.DMatrix(data=X, label=y)

# Create the parameter dictionary: params
params = {"objective":"reg:linear", "max_depth":2}

# Train the model: xg_reg
xg_reg = xgb.train(params=params, dtrain=housing_dmatrix, num_boost_round=10)

# Plot the first tree
xgb.plot_tree(xg_reg,num_trees=0)
plt.show()

# Plot the fifth tree
xgb.plot_tree(xg_reg,num_trees=4)
plt.show()

# Plot the last tree sideways
xgb.plot_tree(xg_reg,num_trees=9, rankdir="LR" )
plt.show()


#Visualizing feature importances: What features are most important in my dataset
#
#Another way to visualize your XGBoost models is to examine the importance of each feature column in the original dataset within the model.
#
#One simple way of doing this involves counting the number of times each feature is split on across all boosting rounds (trees) in the model, and then visualizing the result as a bar graph, with the features ordered according to how many times they appear. XGBoost has a plot_importance() function that allows you to do exactly this, and you'll get a chance to use it in this exercise!

# Create the DMatrix: housing_dmatrix
housing_dmatrix = xgb.DMatrix(data=X, label=y)

# Create the parameter dictionary: params
params = {"objective":"reg:linear",
          "max_depth":4}

# Train the model: xg_reg
xg_reg = xgb.train(params=params, dtrain=housing_dmatrix, num_boost_round=10)

# Plot the feature importances
xgb.plot_importance(xg_reg)
