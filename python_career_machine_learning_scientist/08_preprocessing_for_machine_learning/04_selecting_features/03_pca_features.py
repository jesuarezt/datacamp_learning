#Using PCA
#
#Let's apply PCA to the wine dataset, to see if we can get an increase in our model's accuracy.
from sklearn.decomposition import PCA

# Set up PCA and the X vector for diminsionality reduction
pca = PCA()
wine_X = wine.drop("Type", axis=1)

# Apply PCA to the wine dataset X vector
transformed_X = pca.fit_transform(wine_X)

# Look at the percentage of variance explained by the different components
print(pca.explained_variance_ratio_)

# Split the transformed X and the y labels into training and test sets
X_wine_train, X_wine_test, y_wine_train, y_wine_test = train_test_split(transformed_X,y)

# Fit knn to the training data
knn.fit(X_wine_train,y_wine_train)

# Score knn on the test data and print it out
knn.score(X_wine_test, y_wine_test)
